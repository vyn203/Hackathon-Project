## Introduction
Introducing ... AMBIGO.

Today we are often too familiar with seeing headlines from major news articles detailing the struggles faced by Ambulance services, especailly as covid cases continue to rise.

Our project has the goal of reducing some of the pressure on the Ambulance services by providing transportation to non-critical patients. These patients are ones who are facing a non-life threatening illness or injury but still need immidiate medical treatment, such as a broken bone, concussion or labor.

## Background

When looking into solving this issue of a high ambulance demand we first wanted to get a sense of the scale of EMS incidents. We got data from the [City of Austin's Open Data Portal](https://data.austintexas.gov/) and found a data set that partains to EMS incidents by month using data from the past 11 years. They rank EMS incidents based upon a 5 point priority scale in which 1 is the highest priority and 5 is the lowest.

Here is a quick look at the data from the past five year.

| Year | Total Incidents | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 2017 | 128863 | 10955 | 28823 | 28353 | 46134 | 14598 |
| 2018 | 122470 | 9825 | 27775 | 27869 | 42990 | 14011 |
| 2019 | 126480 | 9233 | 29362 | 28629 | 44441 | 14815 |
| 2020 | 119233 | 8495 | 25981 | 28882 | 40008 | 15867 |
| 2021 | 136321 | 10083 | 31238 | 31334 | 46103 | 17563 |
